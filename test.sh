# --- Test case 1 ---
# Source file does not exist
# Destination file doesn't exist
# Expected functionality: Program errors and quits
# Supresses error output, if ran on command line it displays error message

# This echo statment is only revalent when the command is run
echo "The following message is the copy command aborting, can't get error redirection working"

# --- Test case 2 ---
# Source file exists
# Destination file doesn't exist
# Expected functionality: Program copies source to dest

echo $DATA > source.test1

# Running command
./copy source.test1 dest.test1


# --- Test case 3 ---
# Source file exists
# Destination file exists
# Expected functionality: Program overwrites source to dest

echo $DATA > source.test2

echo "dummy data" > dest.test2

./copy source.test2 dest.test2

# --- Test case 4 ---
# Source directory exists with files
# Destination directory does not exist
# Expected functionality: Program writes source/ to dest/

# --- Test case 5 ---
# Source dir exists
# Dest file exists
# Expected functionality: Files with the same name are overwritten
